# deep-learning-challenge
In this challenge we will use machine learning and neural networks, to use features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## What we will learn from this project:

- How to split and scale the data

- How to create a neural network 

- How to optimize the model

- How to write a report on the Neural Network Model

## Instructions:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:

* Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.
  
* Build a neural network model:
  
  - Specify the number of input features.
    
  - Specify the number of nodes for each layer.
    
  - Add a second hidden layer if necessary.
    
  - Specify the activation functions.
    
  - Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
    
* Inspect, compile, and train the model,

* Optimize the Model

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

  The Anakysis Report contains: 
  
  - An overview of the analysis

  - The results

  - A summary
